# Machine-Learning-project
The aim of this report is to present the performance of several models and compare them with each other.
We performed the model selection through a grid search on various hyper-parameters which explored thousands of configurations by means of 5-fold cross validation. 
All these models have been performed on different dataset. For what concernes the monks dataset, they can be seen here:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK's+Problems , while for the CUP dataset it can be downloaded in the repository.
