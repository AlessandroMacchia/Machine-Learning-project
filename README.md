# Machine-Learning-project
The aim of this report is to present the performance of several models and compare them with each other.
We performed the model selection through a grid search on various hyper-parameters which explored thousands of configurations by means of 5-fold cross validation. 
All these models have been performed on different dataset that can be seen in the repository.
The best model for the CUP ended up being a 3-layer neural network with mini batch strategy.
